Simple RPC service

Context: RPC is a method to communicate resources over a network. RPC is used to make function calls look like they are being executed locally but are actually being executed on a remote machine. Benefits of using RPC include performance where the data being sent can be serialized leading to lighter loads

Objective: Create a simple rpc service in which a client can send a method to be executed that will happen on the server

------

General

1. Standarize request and response formats

Client Side stub

1.We need to initalize a RPCClientStub which acts as our abstraction layer for the client to execute a function over the network
2. The data needs to serialized and deserailized when sending and recieving respectively

Server Side Stub

1. Listen on our server for incoming connections we might need to start a thread within our server process for multiple client connections
2. Same as client side stub step 2
3. Maintain a valid list of callable functions
4. We can cache repeated calls for performance optimization


Optional Features to Implement:

Timeout/Retries
Graceful Shutdown
Dynamic Function Registration, Server Side
Support streaming data for larger request/response
